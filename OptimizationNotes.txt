TicketManager:
    openTicket():
        Array of TicketManagers is locally declared, but never used
            Fix: Removed this line

        GetXXX() is called within itself, but class has access to its
        own private class variable
        Also is assigned to a long, but does not seem to need to be a long
            Fix: Removed function call, used id in its place
        Char array in buff is dynamically allocated but...
            - Never cleaned up
            - Does not need to be dynamically allocated
            Fix:
        Sprintf is used to write to the dynamic char array,
        replaced with string concatenation

        freopen() call...
            trying to open file in buf and redirecting stdin to file
            file is never close

        openTicket(int i) seems to be dead code, removed, TODO - recheck decompilation

Main:
    Changed if else statement that only sets a bool to just a bool
    Functions to read command line args can be replaced with single lines of code
    Fixed bug where input with too few arguments could be accepted
    Fixed bug where extra arguments are permitted and the user is not warned
    Fixed bug where null value for Part was accepted
    Fixed bug where string value for id cause segfault
    Fixed bug where negative value for id caused segfault
    Removed bloat where id was using a long long data type when an int is sufficient
    Removed memory leak where TicketManager object was only deleted if the GetTicket() returned true
