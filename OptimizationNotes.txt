TicketManager:
    openTicket():
        Array of TicketManagers is locally declared, but never used
            Fix: Removed this line

        GetXXX() is called within itself, but class has access to its
        own private class variable
        Also is assigned to a long, but does not seem to need to be a long
            Fix: Removed function call, used id in its place
        Char array in buff is dynamically allocated but...
            - Never cleaned up
            - Does not need to be dynamically allocated
            Fix:
        Sprintf is used to write to the dynamic char array,
        replaced with string concatenation

        freopen() call...
            trying to open file in buf and redirecting stdin to file
            file is never close

        openTicket(int i) seems to be dead code, removed, TODO - recheck decompilation

Main:
    Changed if else statement that only sets a bool to just a bool
    Functions to read command line args seem extraneous, removed
    and adjusted code accordingly

    Code only deleted dynamically allocated TicketManager if getTicket() returned true...
    Should delete anyway at end of function.
    Now there doesn't seem to be a use for GetTicket() in main? Kept for now
